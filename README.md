# Stripe-Demo

Simple credit card payment form using Stripe

- test card = 4242 4242 4242 4242

** What has been done recently:

- Thank-you page added :
- Session variables added to pass order data to ty page from checkout

** To do next :

- Just realised Stripe is only a payment gateway not a CRM so we will need to build a backend for storing Customer delivery data and prospect data.

- Replace checkout form widget with integrated checkout form. Needs to be able to pass order token to our custome back end (CRM) so we can identify customers with their payment details.
